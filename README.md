# Soccer Analysis - Completed May 31, 2022

Welcome to this repository for our work as a part of UC San Diego's [Data Science Student Society's](https://ds3.ucsd.edu/) Winter 2022 Cohort.

This repository contains many of our early functions and Jupyter Notebooks that we used to manually flatten the JSON data to CSVs and Pandas DataFrames, along with some early EDA.

For the majority of our project work, including our final EDA, modeling work, and demo, please check out [this repository](https://github.com/gprasad125/soccerDemo).

## Initial Goals and Notes:
Here you'll find some of our initial ideas from our first brainstorm - many of these did not end up making it into our final project, but instead proved to be areas for future exploration.

Goal: Using in-game player performance statistics to assign value to players.

### Objectives:
* Is a player worth his salary?
* How accurate is FIFA data?
* How to improve a team with different players?
* How to replace transfers?
* Generating a best XI for each year.

### Potential applications:
* Transfer market
* Starting XI decisions
* Measure of form
